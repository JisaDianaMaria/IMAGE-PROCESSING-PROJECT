# IMAGE PROCESSING PROJECT 

__Theme Presentation__

This project aims to create and execute a 3D scene that mimics reality using the technology provided by the OpenGL library. This library, known as the Open Graphics Library, is a universal programming interface intended for creating vector graphics, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional. OpenGL is recognized for its ability to generate high-quality graphic images, making it a crucial tool in the field of computer graphics.

I have developed an animated urban scene that includes a school with sports facilities and a bus station. User interaction with this scene is done directly through the mouse and keyboard, allowing them to navigate within the scene and activate or deactivate various functionalities.

A 3D graphics simulator, using GLFW, GLEW, GLM libraries, and a custom set of classes for window management, shaders, camera, and 3D models.
